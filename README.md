# :dog: Virtual Pet

## Details

This is a virtual pet game made to relive the 90's by bringing back a similar toy we all knew and loved, the Tamagotchi&trade;

You have to care for your little buddy as they're hungry, like constantly... you can feed your buddy with the "Feed" Button and I'll let you work out the rest.
